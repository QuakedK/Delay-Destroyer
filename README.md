# Delay Destroyer
Many latency tweaks do absolutely nothing, it's almost always bullshit. But there's some real and legitimate methods to get the lowest latency/delay.
Running this bat we'll be using and applying the following things to to dramatically reduce latency: Auto Setting Windows Processes Priority, SvcHost Tweaks, System Clock Settings, Priority Separation, Timer Resolution, NDIS Driver Tweaks, Device Manager Tweaks, Power Plan Section and DPC Checker (Known program that fixes timer res on win 10 20H2 and above).

# Usage
1. Download [Delay Destroyer](https://github.com/QuakedK/Delay-Destroyer/releases/download/0delay/Delay-Destroyer-V2.0.bat).
2. Right-click & run it as admin, and almost everything else is automatic, except user-required inputs.
