Many latency Tweaks do absolutely nothing, it's almost always bullshit. But there's some real & legitimate methods, to get the lowest delay/latency.
Using this bat will be using and applying SvcHost Tweaks, System Clock Settings, Priority Separation, Timer Resolution, NDIS Driver Tweaks, Device Manager Tweaks, Power Plan Section
to dramatically reduce latency
